The following features most strongly distinguish high-occupancy properties (Occupancy ≥ 65.2%) from low-occupancy ones (Occupancy ≤ 40.0%):

| Feature         | Difference (High - Low) |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Dishwasher      | **-13.1%** (Less prevalent in high occupancy) |
| Pets            | **+11.8%** (More prevalent in high occupancy) |

| Beach Access    | **+8.3%** (More prevalent in high occupancy) |
| Jacuzzi         | **+6.8%** (More prevalent in high occupancy) |

**Interpretation:**  
High-occupancy properties tend to offer more pet-friendly policies, dedicated workspaces, scenic views (mountain and beach), and luxury amenities like jacuzzis.

## 2. Accessibility & Convenience Features

- **Workspace:** Present in 73.6% of high-occupancy properties vs. 64.1% in low tier (+9.4%). This indicates a strong preference for work-friendly environments, possibly catering to remote workers or business travelers.
- **Washer/Dryer:** Washer (86.2% vs. 90.2%) and Dryer (85.1% vs. 89.1%) are slightly less common in high-occupancy properties (-4.0% and -4.1%, respectively), suggesting these are baseline amenities but not strong differentiators.
- **EV Charger:** Less prevalent in high-occupancy properties (8.0% vs. 13.0%, -5.0%), indicating limited impact on bookings in this area.
- **Superhost Status:** Higher in high-occupancy properties (11.5% vs. 6.5%, +5.0%), which may reflect better guest experience and trust.

**Summary:**  
Workspace availability and Superhost status are positive contributors to higher occupancy. Washer/dryer and EV chargers appear less influential in this market.

## 3. Pet-Friendliness Impact

| Attribute | High Tier Avg | Low Tier Avg | Difference |

- High-occupancy properties tend to be **smaller** in capacity and bedroom count compared to low-occupancy ones.
- The average capacity for high-occupancy properties is about 6 guests, whereas low-occupancy properties average around 7.5 guests.
  
**Insight:**  
Smaller to mid-sized properties (around 6 guests capacity) appear to maximize bookings, possibly due to better alignment with typical guest group sizes or pricing sweet spots.
