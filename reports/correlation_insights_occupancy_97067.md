## 1. Key Differentiators

The following features most strongly distinguish high-occupancy properties (Occupancy ≥ 60%) from low-occupancy ones (Occupancy ≤ 45.4%):

| Feature       | High Tier % | Low Tier % | Difference |
|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Jacuzzi       | 68.5%       | 57.4%      | +11.1%     |
| Grill         | 77.2%       | 86.9%      | -9.7%      |
| Pets Allowed  | 58.3%       | 49.2%      | +9.1%      |
| Dishwasher    | 80.3%       | 89.3%      | -9.0%      |
| Ocean View    | 29.9%       | 22.1%      | +7.8%      |
| Workspace     | 70.1%       | 63.1%      | +7.0%      |
| Mountain View | 13.4%       | 6.6%       | +6.8%      |

**Interpretation:**  
High-occupancy listings are more likely to feature Jacuzzis, allow pets, offer ocean and mountain views, and provide dedicated workspaces. Conversely, low-occupancy properties more commonly have grills and dishwashers, which may not be key booking drivers in this market.

## 2. Accessibility & Convenience Features

Amenities related to guest convenience and remote work show positive correlations with higher occupancy:

- **Workspace:** 70.1% in high-occupancy vs. 63.1% in low-occupancy (+7.0%)  
- **Washer:** Slightly less prevalent in high-occupancy (89.0%) vs. low (91.8%), difference -2.8%  
- **Dryer:** Slightly less prevalent in high-occupancy (87.4%) vs. low (91.0%), difference -3.6%  
- **TV:** Nearly universal in high-occupancy (99.2%) and slightly less in low (95.9%) (+3.3%)  

**Insight:**  
A dedicated workspace is a meaningful differentiator, likely catering to remote workers or business travelers. Washer and dryer availability is high across both groups but slightly less common in high-occupancy listings, suggesting these are baseline expectations rather than competitive advantages.

## 3. Pet-Friendliness Impact

- **Pets Allowed:** 58.3% in high-occupancy vs. 49.2% in low-occupancy (+9.1%)

**Conclusion:**  
Allowing pets correlates positively with higher occupancy rates in this market. Pet-friendly listings appear more attractive to guests, potentially expanding the booking pool.

## 4. Capacity Sweet Spot

| Attribute  | High Tier Avg | Low Tier Avg | Difference |
|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Capacity   | 6.33          | 7.43         | -1.10      |
| Bedrooms   | 2.8           | 3.13         | -0.32      |
| Beds       | 4.21          | 4.92         | -0.71      |
| Bathrooms  | 2.23          | 2.37         | -0.14      |

**Interpretation:**  
High-occupancy properties tend to be slightly smaller in capacity, bedrooms, and beds compared to low-occupancy ones. This suggests a **sweet spot around 6 guests and ~3 bedrooms** maximizes bookings, possibly because these properties better match the typical guest group size in this area.

## 5. Availability Patterns

*Note: No explicit data on days available was provided.*

**Inference:**  
While direct availability data is missing, the sample descriptions of high-occupancy listings emphasize flexibility for groups, multiple units, and unique experiences (e.g., multiple cabins, Airstreams). This may imply that properties offering diverse accommodation options and consistent availability throughout the year attract more bookings.

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts

1. **Add or Highlight Jacuzzi and Hot Tub Amenities:** With an 11.1% higher prevalence in high-occupancy listings, these features strongly attract guests.

2. **Allow Pets:** Increasing pet-friendliness by 9.1% correlates with higher bookings; consider updating policies and marketing to pet owners.

3. **Create Dedicated Workspaces:** Given the +7.0% difference, providing a comfortable, well-equipped workspace can appeal to remote workers.

4. **Optimize Property Size:** Aim for properties that accommodate around 6 guests with ~3 bedrooms to hit the capacity sweet spot.

5. **Emphasize Scenic Views:** Ocean and mountain views (+7.8% and +6.8%) are valued; if available, showcase these prominently in listings.
