High-occupancy properties allow pets in 72.2% of cases compared to only 45.0% in low-occupancy properties, resulting in a **+27.2%** difference. This suggests that pet-friendly listings are more appealing to potential guests.

## 4. Capacity Sweet Spot
The average capacity of high-occupancy properties is **9.17 guests**, while low-occupancy properties average **10.35 guests**. The difference of **-1.18 guests** indicates that smaller properties may be booked more frequently, as they cater to smaller groups seeking a more intimate experience.

## 5. Availability Patterns
While the data does not explicitly provide availability patterns, it can be inferred that properties with fewer days blocked off for personal use may have higher occupancy rates. Hosts should consider maintaining flexible availability to attract more bookings.

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts
To increase booking frequency, hosts should consider the following actionable recommendations:

1. **Emphasize Pet-Friendliness**: Highlight pet-friendly features in listings to attract a broader audience.
2. **Enhance Comfort Features**: Invest in amenities like fireplaces and outdoor spaces (e.g., fire pits, hammocks) that enhance guest experience.
3. **Optimize Capacity**: Consider targeting smaller groups by offering properties that accommodate fewer guests, as they may be booked more frequently.
4. **Maintain Availability**: Ensure that properties have flexible booking options to maximize occupancy potential.
5. **Promote Unique Views**: If applicable, market properties with mountain or ocean views, as these features can significantly enhance attractiveness.

These insights are tailored to the specific market of zipcode '97067' and can help hosts optimize their listings for better performance.
