## 3. Capacity & Size Analysis

There is a clear positive relationship between property size and ADR:

| Attribute | High Tier Avg | Low Tier Avg | Difference |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Capacity (guests) | 10.28 | 4.72 | +5.55 |
| Bedrooms | 3.9 | 2.25 | +1.65 |
| Beds | 6.59 | 3.25 | +3.34 |
| Bathrooms | 2.8 | 2.02 | +0.78 |

**Insight:** Larger properties accommodating around 10 guests with nearly 4 bedrooms and multiple bathrooms command significantly higher rates. The optimal size for maximum ADR appears to be a spacious lodge or cabin suitable for groups and families, consistent with sample descriptions highlighting group-friendly spaces.

## 4. Pet Policy Impact

- **Pets Allowed:** 58.6% of high-ADR properties vs. 50.6% of low-ADR properties (+8.0%)

Allowing pets correlates with a modestly higher ADR in this market, suggesting pet-friendly policies can be a value-add for attracting higher-paying guests.

---

## 5. Description Language Patterns

**High-ADR Listings:**

- Emphasize **spaciousness** and **group accommodation** (e.g., "accommodating up to 16 guests", "ideal for large groups").
- Highlight **luxury and comfort**: mentions of "cozy gas fireplace," "chef's kitchen," "private hot tub," "serene bedrooms," and "modern luxury."
- Focus on **unique experiences and amenities**: "converted pool table," "game room," "outdoor firepit," "waterfront lodge," "mountain views."
- Use evocative, aspirational language: "ultimate getaway," "luxury retreat," "unforgettable experience."

**Low-ADR Listings:**

- Stress **coziness and charm** over luxury (e.g., "bursting with charm and coziness," "perfect mountain getaway").
- Highlight **location and outdoor activities** rather than upscale amenities (e.g., proximity to trails, forests, and ski areas).
- Language is more functional and straightforward, focusing on "modern comforts" and "quiet, wooded clearing."

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts

1. **Invest in Luxury Amenities:** Adding or highlighting features such as jacuzzis/hot tubs, grills, firepits, and pool tables can significantly boost nightly rates.

2. **Increase Capacity and Comfort:** Expanding sleeping capacity to accommodate larger groups (around 10 guests) with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms aligns with higher ADR properties.

3. **Enhance Scenic Appeal:** If possible, emphasize or create ocean or mountain views, as these are strongly associated with premium pricing.

4. **Adopt a Pet-Friendly Policy:** Allowing pets can attract a broader market segment and is correlated with higher ADR in this zipcode.

5. **Craft Premium Descriptions:** Use evocative, aspirational language that highlights spaciousness, luxury, unique amenities, and memorable experiences to differentiate your listing.
