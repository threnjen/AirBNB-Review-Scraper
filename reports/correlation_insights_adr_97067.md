These amenities enhance the overall guest experience, contributing to higher nightly rates.

## 3. Capacity & Size Analysis
There is a clear relationship between property size and ADR:

- **Capacity**: High-ADR properties have an average capacity of 11.5 guests compared to 8.17 guests in low-ADR properties (+3.33 difference).
- **Bedrooms**: High-ADR properties average 4.44 bedrooms, while low-ADR properties average 3.0 bedrooms (+1.44 difference).

- **Bathrooms**: High-ADR properties have an average of 2.72 bathrooms, compared to 2.0 in low-ADR properties (+0.72 difference).

The optimal size for maximum rates appears to be properties that can accommodate larger groups, with more bedrooms and bathrooms, enhancing comfort and convenience.

## 4. Pet Policy Impact
The pet policy shows a slight negative correlation with ADR:

- **Pets Allowed**: 55.6% of high-ADR properties allow pets, while 61.1% of low-ADR properties do. This results in a -5.6% difference.

This suggests that properties that do not allow pets may attract a higher-paying clientele who prioritize luxury and amenities over pet-friendliness.

## 5. Description Language Patterns
Premium listings tend to emphasize the following aspects in their descriptions:

- **Spaciousness and Comfort**: High-ADR properties often highlight their capacity to accommodate large groups and the comfort of their living spaces (e.g., "spacious mountain getaway" and "inviting great room").
- **Luxury Features**: Descriptions frequently mention luxury amenities such as hot tubs, game rooms, and outdoor spaces (e.g., "private suite for ultimate relaxation" and "fun game room").
- **Location and Activities**: High-ADR properties emphasize proximity to outdoor activities and scenic views, enhancing their appeal (e.g., "endless adventure just minutes away").

In contrast, low-ADR properties focus more on solitude and basic amenities, which may not attract premium guests.

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts
To increase their nightly rates, hosts should consider the following actionable recommendations:

1. **Enhance Amenities**: Invest in luxury amenities such as a pool table, hot tub, or outdoor grill to attract guests looking for premium experiences.
2. **Optimize Capacity**: Consider expanding the property to accommodate larger groups by adding more bedrooms and bathrooms, which can justify higher rates.
3. **Focus on Descriptions**: Use descriptive language that emphasizes spaciousness, luxury features, and nearby attractions to make listings more appealing.
4. **Evaluate Pet Policy**: Consider the impact of allowing pets on pricing and guest demographics; a no-pets policy may attract a higher-paying clientele.
5. **Highlight Unique Features**: If the property has unique views or special features (like a fireplace or outdoor space), make sure these are prominently featured in the listing description.

By implementing these strategies, hosts can better position their properties in the competitive market of zipcode '97067' and potentially increase their average daily rates.
