## 3. Capacity & Size Analysis

There is a clear positive relationship between property size and ADR:

| Attribute  | High ADR Avg | Low ADR Avg | Difference |
|------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Capacity   | 10.28 guests | 4.72 guests | +5.55      |
| Bedrooms   | 3.9          | 2.25        | +1.65      |
| Beds       | 6.59         | 3.25        | +3.34      |
| Bathrooms  | 2.8          | 2.02        | +0.78      |

**Insight:** High-ADR properties accommodate more than double the guests on average, with nearly 4 bedrooms and close to 3 bathrooms. This suggests that **larger properties designed for groups or families command premium pricing** in this market.

## 4. Pet Policy Impact

- **Pets Allowed:** 58.6% in high-ADR vs. 50.6% in low-ADR (+8.0%)

Allowing pets correlates with a modest increase in ADR prevalence. This suggests **pet-friendly policies may contribute positively to pricing**, possibly by appealing to a broader market segment seeking vacation rentals that accommodate pets.

---

## 5. Description Language Patterns

**High-ADR listings emphasize:**

- Spaciousness and capacity for large groups (e.g., "accommodating up to 16 guests," "ideal for large groups")
- Luxury and comfort (e.g., "cozy gas fireplace," "chef's kitchen," "private suite," "modern luxury")
- Unique experiences and outdoor amenities (e.g., "hot tub," "firepit," "deck among evergreens," "serene mountain views")
- Activity and relaxation options (e.g., "game room," "outdoor space," "waterfront lodge")

**Low-ADR listings focus on:**

- Cozy, intimate settings (e.g., "two-bedroom cabin," "romantic getaway")
- Proximity to nature and activities (e.g., "near hiking trails," "quiet wooded clearing")
- Practical comforts and convenience (e.g., "modern comforts," "single-level floor plan")

**Summary:** Premium listings market themselves as spacious, luxurious retreats with multiple entertainment options and scenic views, targeting larger groups seeking upscale experiences. Lower-tier listings emphasize charm, coziness, and access to outdoor recreation.

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts

1. **Invest in High-Value Amenities:** Adding or highlighting features like jacuzzis/hot tubs, grills, firepits, and game rooms can significantly increase nightly rates.

2. **Increase Capacity and Bedrooms:** Expanding the number of bedrooms and overall guest capacity to accommodate larger groups can drive higher ADR.

3. **Enhance Scenic Appeal:** If possible, promote or create ocean or mountain views, as these are strong differentiators for premium pricing.

4. **Adopt a Pet-Friendly Policy:** Allowing pets can broaden your market and is associated with higher ADR in this area.

5. **Craft Descriptions to Highlight Luxury and Space:** Use language that emphasizes spaciousness, luxury amenities, and unique experiences to attract higher-paying guests.
