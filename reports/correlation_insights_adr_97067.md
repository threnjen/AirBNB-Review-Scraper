## 3. Capacity & Size Analysis

There is a clear positive relationship between property size and ADR:

| Attribute  | High Tier Avg | Low Tier Avg | Difference |
|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Capacity   | 10.12         | 4.42         | +5.70      |
| Bedrooms   | 3.89          | 2.28         | +1.62      |
| Beds       | 6.56          | 3.05         | +3.51      |
| Bathrooms  | 2.8           | 2.0          | +0.80      |

**Insight:** Larger properties accommodating bigger groups (approximately 4+ bedrooms and 10 guests) command significantly higher ADRs. The optimal size for maximum rates appears to be spacious lodges or multi-bedroom homes designed for group stays.

## 4. Pet Policy Impact

- The data provided does not explicitly include pet policy statistics.
- However, none of the sample descriptions or amenity tables mention pets as a differentiator.
- Given the lack of data, **no conclusive correlation between allowing pets and ADR can be established for this market**.

---

## 5. Description Language Patterns

**High-ADR Listings:**

- Emphasize **spaciousness** and **group accommodation** (e.g., "accommodating up to 16 guests," "ideal for large groups").
- Highlight **luxury and unique features**: "cozy gas fireplace," "stunning mountain views," "chef’s kitchen," "hot tub," "sauna," "game room."
- Use evocative, experience-driven language: "rustic elegance meets modern luxury," "create lasting memories," "serene bedrooms," "fun game room."
- Mention **outdoor amenities** and scenic surroundings: "deck among evergreens," "private woodland," "mountain getaway."

**Low-ADR Listings:**

- Focus on **coziness and convenience**: "cute and cozy A-Frame cabin," "comforts of home," "nearby activities."
- Highlight **basic amenities** and location: proximity to hiking, skiing, golf.
- Use simpler, functional language without luxury emphasis.

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts

1. **Invest in Luxury Amenities:** Adding or highlighting features like Jacuzzis/hot tubs, grills, firepits, and ocean or mountain views can significantly increase nightly rates.

2. **Increase Capacity and Bedrooms:** Consider expanding sleeping arrangements to accommodate larger groups (8-16 guests), as bigger properties command higher ADRs.

3. **Enhance Outdoor and Entertainment Spaces:** Incorporate game rooms, pool tables, and comfortable outdoor seating to appeal to premium guests.

4. **Use Descriptive, Experience-Focused Language:** Craft listings that emphasize spaciousness, luxury, unique features, and memorable experiences rather than just functional descriptions.

5. **Ensure High-Quality Kitchen and Laundry Amenities:** Features like dishwashers, washers, and dryers are more common in high-ADR properties and improve guest convenience.
