## 3. Capacity & Size Analysis

There is a clear positive relationship between property size and ADR:

| Attribute  | High Tier Avg | Low Tier Avg | Difference |
|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Capacity   | 9.62          | 4.94         | +4.68      |
| Bedrooms   | 3.64          | 2.38         | +1.26      |
| Beds       | 6.16          | 3.38         | +2.78      |
| Bathrooms  | 2.64          | 1.98         | +0.66      |

**Insight:** Larger properties that accommodate bigger groups (around 9-10 guests) with more bedrooms and bathrooms achieve significantly higher ADRs. The optimal size for maximum rates in this market appears to be:

- **Capacity:** ~9-10 guests
- **Bedrooms:** 3.5 to 4 bedrooms
- **Bathrooms:** 2.5 to 3 bathrooms

This aligns with the sample high-ADR listings which emphasize spaciousness and suitability for large groups or family reunions.

## 4. Pet Policy Impact

- Pet-friendly properties are slightly more common in high-tier (58.7%) than low-tier (52.9%) listings, a difference of +5.8%.

**Insight:** Allowing pets correlates with a marginally higher ADR in this market, suggesting that pet-friendly policies may enhance appeal and justify premium pricing, especially for larger group accommodations.

---

## 5. Description Language Patterns

**High-ADR Listings:**

- Emphasize **spaciousness** and **group suitability** (e.g., "accommodating up to 16 guests," "ideal for large groups")
- Highlight **luxury and comfort** features such as "cozy gas fireplace," "chef's kitchen," "private suite," and "modern luxury"
- Use evocative, experiential language focusing on **nature and tranquility** ("serene bedrooms," "stunning mountain views," "banks of the Sandy River")
- Mention **multiple entertainment options** ("pool table," "game room," "hot tub," "firepit")

**Low-ADR Listings:**

- Focus on **cozy, rustic charm** and **intimate settings** ("cozy cabin," "rustic charm," "warm, whimsical spirit")
- Highlight **basic comforts** and proximity to activities ("wood-burning fireplace," "full kitchen," "fast WiFi," "pet-friendly")
- Emphasize **quiet solitude and family connection** rather than luxury or large group capacity

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts

1. **Invest in High-Value Amenities:** Adding or highlighting features such as a jacuzzi/hot tub, grill, firepit, and fireplace can significantly increase nightly rates.

2. **Optimize for Larger Groups:** Consider expanding capacity to around 9-10 guests with 3-4 bedrooms and multiple bathrooms to attract premium bookings.

3. **Enhance Scenic Appeal:** If possible, promote or create ocean or mountain views, as these are strongly associated with higher ADRs.

4. **Adopt a Pet-Friendly Policy:** Allowing pets can slightly boost appeal and rates, especially for family or group travelers.

5. **Craft Descriptions to Emphasize Luxury and Space:** Use language that highlights spaciousness, comfort, and unique experiences (e.g., "luxury retreat," "serene views," "multiple entertainment options") to attract higher-paying guests.
