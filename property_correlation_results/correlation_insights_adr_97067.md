| Capacity       | 11.5          | 8.17         | +41%                  |

These features indicate that larger properties with more bedrooms, beds, and bathrooms tend to command higher nightly rates.

## 2. Luxury Amenity Patterns
The following amenities correlate with premium pricing in the high-ADR tier:

- **Hot Tub**: Commonly found in high-ADR properties, providing a luxury experience.
- **Game Room**: Offers entertainment options that appeal to larger groups.
- **Spacious Outdoor Areas**: Properties with outdoor features like fire pits and grills enhance the guest experience.
- **Scenic Views**: Listings that highlight mountain views or proximity to nature often attract higher rates.

While all properties in both tiers have similar amenities, the experience and luxury associated with these features in high-ADR properties likely contribute to their pricing.

## 3. Capacity & Size Analysis
There is a clear relationship between property size and ADR:

- High-ADR properties have an average capacity of **11.5 guests**, compared to **8.17 guests** in low-ADR properties, indicating a preference for larger accommodations.
- The average number of bedrooms (4.44 vs. 3.0) and beds (7.39 vs. 4.94) further supports the trend that larger properties attract higher rates.

The optimal size for maximum rates appears to be properties that can comfortably accommodate **10-12 guests**, with at least **4 bedrooms** and **3 bathrooms**.

## 4. Pet Policy Impact
In this analysis, both high-ADR and low-ADR properties allow pets at **100%** prevalence. Therefore, the pet policy does not appear to correlate with higher or lower ADR in this market, suggesting that pet-friendly accommodations are a standard expectation across the board.

## 5. Description Language Patterns
Premium listings tend to use more evocative and descriptive language, emphasizing:

- **Spaciousness**: Highlighting the ability to accommodate large groups.
- **Luxury Features**: Mentioning amenities like hot tubs, game rooms, and scenic views.
- **Experience-Oriented Descriptions**: Focusing on activities available nearby (e.g., skiing, hiking) and the overall experience of staying in the property.

In contrast, lower-ADR listings often focus on basic amenities and the tranquility of the location without the same emphasis on luxury or experience.

## 6. Recommendations for Hosts
To increase nightly rates, hosts should consider the following actionable recommendations:

1. **Enhance Property Size**: If feasible, consider adding more bedrooms or beds to accommodate larger groups, as this correlates with higher ADR.
   
2. **Invest in Luxury Amenities**: Adding features like hot tubs, game rooms, or outdoor entertainment spaces can significantly enhance appeal and justify higher rates.

3. **Optimize Descriptions**: Use engaging and descriptive language in listings to convey the unique experiences guests can expect, focusing on luxury and spaciousness.

4. **Highlight Local Attractions**: Emphasize proximity to local attractions and activities in property descriptions to attract guests looking for experiences.

5. **Maintain High Standards**: Ensure that the property is well-maintained and offers a clean, inviting atmosphere, as this can lead to positive reviews and repeat bookings, ultimately supporting higher pricing.
