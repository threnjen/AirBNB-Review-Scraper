I wasn't about to walk up that hill after climbing Mt St Helens, my legs were gone. So the host isn't lying when they say you need a 4WD. If you're not an idiot though, its manageable.<br/>Other than that, my stay went fine. You can expect to have zero cell coverage in Rhododendron, and I feel like this stay should've been in the $150 range instead of $230, just on lack of amenities. No wifi, TV has DVD player only, Fire pit was unavailable. Throw a hot tub on the front porch and maybe the rental cost would be justified.

The driveway is not only a pain when loading/unloading if you don't have 4WD; it's steep and gravel covered and I found it difficult just to walk the 100 yards of it not even carrying much.  The place is very isolated visually, completely surrounded by trees and vegetation, which is really nice.  However, it's fewer than two tenths of a mile from the highway as the crow flies, so outside the house, there is often a lot of noise from this very busy road.  (Inside the house it's quiet.)  <br/>While it might be romantic to be \"off the grid,\" it can be difficult to plan activities from the house because you can't reach a map server to find how far away things are and how to get to them.  Although absolutely nothing went wrong for me while there, you can't text the owner from the house because there's no service.  And regardless of how old you are or what kind of shape you're in, getting up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom is uncomfortable due to the steep climb up and down the bedroom ladder.  The <br/>washer/dryer was really nice.  There is nothing the owner can do about the steep climb to the bedroom because the place is small; however, the driveway could be improved and a wifi scan at the house revealed several nearby networks so I think connectivity could be improved too.", "rating": 3}, {"review": "The cabin is simply amazing.

I suggest getting everything you need (food, wood, water, etc.) before you arrive to minimize your trips up and down the driveway. The dollar store down the road had the best prices. <br/>The only issues we had were getting the door to lock and no phone service. The phone service wasn\u2019t an issue besides not being able to communicate about the door issue or check in. I suggest you plan out your daily activities and find restaurants/hiking trails you want to go to before you get there because it will be more challenging to do without service. <br/>Overall great trip!

Beautiful trees surround the property and the views from the windows and from the front deck/porch is picturesque. <br/>One thing to consider is the ladder up to the loft bedroom. If you are elderly, you might have a hard time getting up and down the ladder as the incline is a little steep. My wife and I are young (mid-20\u2019s) so it didn\u2019t bother us in the slightest, but it may be something to consider if you are concerned about your mobility. <br/>I think this is a \u201cdon\u2019t miss out\u201d type of place.

Susan was great to be in touch with and my friend and I enjoyed cooking dinner and sitting out late watching the stars. It was super cozy and we really enjoyed our way too short stay.", "rating": 5}, {"review": "Amazing retreat in the woods!  We had the most relaxing time- the cabin is so clean and well decorated (pictures don't even do it justice)!  We will be back!", "rating": 5}, {"review": "Perfect location and unique place. Every detail was thought of in this beautifully decorated cabin. The bed was very comfortable and the cabin has everything that you need. The fire pit and landscaping are done just as creatively as the rest of the place and offer another relaxing space to spend time. Susan was quick to answer any questions and offered local tips. The whole experience was wonderful and we would recommend this gem to anyone wanting something better than the average stay.", "rating": 5}, {"review": "Cute comfy place tucked away in the woods.", "rating": 5}, {"review": "This is a hidden gem amongst a beautiful forest.

We spent a lot of time just admiring all the surroundings and taking advantage of the fire pit (don\u2019t forget to grab some marshmallows down the road).", "rating": 5}, {"review": "Susan was quick to respond to any question I had.  The cabin was a beautiful, cozy place to stay surrounded by trees.  It was exactly what I was hoping for!", "rating": 5}, {"review": "Beautiful cabin with modern amenities and a stunning location. We loved everything about our stay here from the cabin itself, the views, the beautiful outdoor space and fire pit and covered porch, and the location close to Mount Hood. The location was great - convenient access to grocery stores and the Mt. Hood Express Bus for mountain biking, yet it felt incredibly secluded and far from removed from everything. One of the highlights of our trip through Oregon and we would definitely stay again.", "rating": 5}, {"review": "This is an amazing place. Beautiful spot hidden among beautiful moss covered trees. Very stylish and spotlessly clean.", "rating": 5}, {"review": "A very conveniently located and super stylish getaway. We wanted to be near Mt Hood yet also have a little area of our own vs camping. Something that would be cozy indoors and out. It\u2019s the perfect spot for two. You have so many amenities, but you will have to bring or buy some basics. Other than that, you have your own fire inside or out. Decor was very well done, and when sitting on the couch next to the big picture window you can\u2019t help to imagine you\u2019re in the trees...because you\u2019re surrounded by them and all that lush greenery! You will love this little escape and can easily drive up to Timberline or any of the surrounding lakes to get a good hike in!", "rating": 5}, {"review": "A wonderful cottage away from the road. The hosts have thought of everything to make your stay as stress-free as possible.

It was peaceful, comfortable and incredibly unique. Make sure you bring whatever is needed, such as coffee or snacks. Dishes and bare necessities are provided.
